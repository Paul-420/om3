A `<signal>:<target>` whitespace-separated list, where `<signal>` is a signal
name or number (ex. `1`, `hup` or `sighup`), and target is the comma-separated
list of resource ids to send the signal to (ex: `container#1,container#2`).

If only the signal is specified, all candidate resources will be signaled.

This keyword is typically used to reload daemons on certificate or configuration
files changes.
