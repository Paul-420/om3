If `true`, set the zfs property `multihost=on` on start if not already set.
This requires all nodes to be booted with a `/etc/hostid` installed,
preferably generated by the `zgenhostid` command.

If `false`, set the zfs property `multihost=off`.

If left empty, the current `multihost` property is left unchanged.
