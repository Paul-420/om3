Support limited, concurrent runs of tasks.

The task#xx.max_parallel=2 setting limits the number of concurrent task runs to 2.

The default value is 1, ensuring backward compatibility.

The run count is determined based on PID files created in the <resource var>/run/ directories.

The PID file is normally removed when the task execution ends, but if the executor dies abruptly (e.g., due to a SIGKILL), the stale PID file is not considered when computing the resource status. It is removed before the count check of the next run.

Staleness is evaluated using the condition: (PID file mtime < process birth time).

A new status log message may appear to indicate that the maximum concurrency limit has been reached.
