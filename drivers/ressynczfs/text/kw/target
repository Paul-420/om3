Which nodes should receive this data sync from the `PRD` node where the
instance is up and running.

A shared filesystem (shared disk, replicated disk, clustered fs or
networked fs) does not need a target for nodes where the fs resource can
be started.

`target=local` allows updating a `dst` dataset on the same server that
sends the data from the `src` dataset.
