The netmask to configure with the address resolved from `name`.

If an ip is already plumbed on the root interface, the netmask default is the
netmask of this existing ip.

`netmask` is mandatory for interfaces dedicated to the object. Dummy interfaces
are likely to be in this case.

The format is:

* dotted or octal for IPv4, ex: `255.255.252.0` or `22`.

* octal only for IPv6, ex: `64`.
