The interface name to setup the ip address on.

This interface can be different from one node to the other, in which case the
`dev@<nodename>` scoping syntax can be used.

If the value is expressed as `<intf>:<n>`, the stacked interface index is
forced to `<n>` instead of the lowest free index.

If the value is expressed as `<name>@<intf>`, a macvtap interface named
`<name>` is created and attached to `<intf>`.
