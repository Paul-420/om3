Action errors on optional resources are logged but do not interrupt the action sequence.

The status of optional resources is not included in the instance availability status but is considered in the overall status.

The status of task and sync resources is always included in the overall status, regardless of whether they are marked as optional.

Resources tagged as `noaction` are considered optional by default.

Dump filesystems are a typical use case for optional=true.
