Set to `false` to ignore the `provision` and `unprovision` actions on the
resource.

> **Warning**: `provision` and `unprovision` use data-destructive operations
  like formatting.

It is recommended to set `provision=false` on long-lived critical objects,
to force administrators to remove this setting when they really want to
destroy data.
