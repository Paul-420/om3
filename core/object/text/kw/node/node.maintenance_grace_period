A duration expression, like `1m30s`, defining how long the daemon keeps
remote node data while it is known to be in `maintenance`.

The maintenance state is announced to peers at the beginning of a `daemon
stop` and `daemon restart`, but not on daemon shutdown.

As long as the remote node data is kept, the local daemon won't takeover
the instances running on the node in maintenance.

This parameter should be adjusted to span the daemon restart time.
