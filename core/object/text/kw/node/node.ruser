Set the remote user to use to login to a remote node with ssh and rsync.

The remote user must have the privileges to run as root the following commands
on the remote node:

* om
* rsync

The default ruser is root for all nodes.

`ruser` accepts a list of `user[@node]`.
If @node is omitted, user is considered the new default user.
