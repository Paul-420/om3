The node suicide method to use when a cluster split occurs and the node does
not have the quorum.

This opting-out is meant to avoid double-start situations when the cluster
is split.

Possible values are:

* `crash`

  Default.

* `reboot`

  May be preferred when the node power-on is not easy. No remote access via
  IPMI or equivalent for example.

* `disabled`

  May be used for test or training only (it does nothing).
