The nodes participating to the heartbeat.

This keyword can be used to setup a partial redundancy like:

	       n1   n2   n3   n4
	hb#1   O    O    O    O
	hb#2   O    O          
	hb#1             O    O

Which can be relevant if n[12] are in the same bladecenter b1, and n[34] are
in the same bladecenter b2. The bladecenter having an internal network
completely hardware independent of the network used to go outside of the
bladecenters.
