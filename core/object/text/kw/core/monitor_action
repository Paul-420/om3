The action to trigger when a monitored resource is no longer in the "up" or
"standby up" state, and all restart attempts for the resource have failed.

The reboot and crash monitor actions do not attempt to cleanly stop any
processes. On Linux, they utilize system-level sysrq triggers.

This behavior is designed to ensure that the host stops writing to shared
disks as quickly as possible, minimizing the risk of data corruption. This
is critical because a failover node is likely preparing to write to the same
shared disks.

You can append a fallback monitor action to this keyword. A common example
is "freezestop reboot". In this case, the reboot action will be executed
if the stop fails or times out.
