The maximum duration of the instance status evaluation.

For example, the total start action duration is constrained by different timeouts:

* the `start_timeout`
  Limiting the start action duration.

* the `stop_timeout`
  Limiting the start rollback duration triggered by start errors.

* the `status_timeout`
  Limiting the post-start instance status evaluation duration.
